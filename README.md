# TOWER OF HANOI ACTUAL VISUALIZATION

This visualization will help students visually grasp the working of recursive algorithms. Just printing out lines does not provide a good understanding of the tower of Hanoi problem

**javascript is tricky!**  
Coding this alogorithm in other languages may have been better, but using javascript lets us make use of the HTML canvas. I usually don't use semicolon in javascript, but here I encountered some bugs, so I had to use semicolon in some places.

Using splice method on array also caused problems as it changes the array (side-effect).
